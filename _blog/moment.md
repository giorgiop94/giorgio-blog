# Take a Moment to Re-Assess

###### What a clumsy Vietnamese restaurant taught me about Personal Reviews

*Reading time: 4 minutes*

This essay was originally sent through my newsletter – [INTERMITTENT 
INSIGHTS](https://giorgiop.com/letters/)

A few months ago, I visited the most disorganized “restaurant” I’ve ever been to.

A modest but trendy street food joint with over fifty customers perching on tiny plastic chairs. Something
like this:

=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)There were 5-7 waiters, 
and none of them had a clue which table to deliver each dish.

Every time food came out of the “kitchen” (it was more of a food stall), a waiter would walk around 
feeling lost like a bee in a faux flower shop, trying to randomly guess the correct table.

There was no rule.

**All servers could take orders, but no one would write them down. There was no division of sitting areas.
It was total randomness, confusion, and running all the time.**

As I was in awe, watching this remarkable scene, a waiter came by and gave me a free drink. He said that 
he couldn’t find who ordered it and that I seemed like a nice guy so I should have it. Sounds crazy but 
true. I swear.

Ironically, they found the client right after I took my first sip.

## Lesson Learned

As I sat there, puzzled, I thought there was something to learn from this experience.

**Sometimes, like those waiters, we are overwhelmed with everything going on (school, relationships, 
work), so we run on autopilot.**

We think that if we took a moment to breathe and re-assess our situation, we’d drown in commitments. So we
continue doing whatever necessary to stay afloat. Work harder. Even if it’s inefficient or 
counterproductive.

**We are so caught up in the micro that we forget about the macro.**

It would have taken the waiters less than five minutes to split tables, or agree to write down orders.With
minimal planning, they could have boosted their efficiency, reduced their stress, and improved customer 
experience.

Derek Sivers faced a similar issue when running CD Baby. He was too overwhelmed to spend time properly 
training his employees, so he continued doing almost everything himself. Eventually, he burned out. Then, 
he realized that he had to take the time to train his personnel. It was hard, but afterward, his team 
started running the business and [Derek could focus on improvements and 
innovations](https://sive.rs/delegate) (the stuff that he liked!).

**We can do the same when we feel that we are not running our life as much as our life obligations are 
running us.**

It takes as little as 15 minutes/week to assess if you are spending time in the best way to move towards 
where you want to be. Then, you can figure out ways to improve.

### Where do you want to go?

If you don’t have any vision or direction for your life, it’s good to spend some time figuring that out 
first.

**If you cruise through life with no direction, you’ll be steered wherever the winds take you. 
Unfortunately, in society, there are powerful cyclones that will blow who doesn’t have a direction towards
an unsatisfactory rat race.**

**Ikigai is a very useful framework to figure out where you want to go**. Its basic concept is to 
brainstorm as many answers as possible to the following four prompts. Then look for common, overlapping 
answers.

1. What you love
2. What the World needs
3. What you can be paid for
4. What you are good at

> “Vision is the bottleneck of talent. Most talent is wasted because people do not clearly know what they

## Assessing your direction

**Once you have an idea of where you want to go, it’s crucial to set up some checkpoints along the way.**

These will help you to assess whether you are moving toward your vision, or if needed, they can help you 
decide on a change of direction.

In the productivity world, these checkpoints are known as personal reviews. They can be done annually, 
monthly, weekly, or whenever you prefer.

**The purpose of personal reviews is to ensure that you don’t get lost in the daily grind and keep in mind
the grand scheme of your life.** It was partly thanks to my regular weekly review that I decided to quit 
my job.

Week after week, I kept facing the fact that my job was making me miserable and not bringing me any closer
to my long-term vision. After a while, it was natural to opt for a change of direction (I go more into the
reasons for quitting (https://giorgiop.com/job/)).

If you want to start the habit of a weekly or monthly review, (https://giorgiop.com/fail/). Your habit 
will feel less overwhelming and easier to complete.

**A weekly review can be as simple as having a Google Doc with five prompts on it**, such as:

* Review your life vision and set sub-goals for this week
* What do I want to learn by the end of this week?
* Did I achieve my goals last week?
* What went well last week?
* What didn’t go well last week, and how can I learn/improve from it?

I made (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G41EEpTEyxE-wLA3C3pD7uUPAcZ-VX7_WW9UHLlrru4/edit?usp=sharing).

To make the habit stick, it’s useful to set up a recurring reminder on your calendar or task on your to-do
list. I do it every Sunday.

You can set one up now → (https://calendar.google.com/)

As you make your weekly review a habit and become familiar with it, you can customize it according to your
needs and preferences.

**Some people might think that setting aside 15-30 minutes each week for a personal review would be a 
waste of their precious time.** Especially when they already feel overwhelmed, lagging behind, unable to 
find a moment to relax.

**I’m sure the restaurant waiters thought the same.**
