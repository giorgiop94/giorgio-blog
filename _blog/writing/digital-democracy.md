In the past few years, the Taiwanese government attracted international praise for introducing a number of civic innovations to improve the democratic process ([1](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/03/12/inside-taiwans-new-digital-democracy)), fight disinformation ([2](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/17/humour-over-rumour-taiwan-fake-news)) and deal with the COVID pandemic ([3](https://theconversation.com/hacking-the-pandemic-how-taiwans-digital-democracy-holds-covid-19-at-bay-145023), [4](https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-is-beating-the-coronavirus-can-the-us-do-the-same/))).

In this short post, I give a brief overview of vTaiwan, one of the inspiring innovations introduced in the past few years by the Taiwanese government.

## What is vTaiwan?

> "vTaiwan is an open consultation process that brings Taiwan citizens and government together in online and offline spaces, to deliberate and reach rough consensus on national issues, and to craft national digital legislation." Hsiao et al. 2018

To date, vTaiwan has been used for settling a few "smaller" public debates, such as regulating Uber, online alcohol sales and the platform economy. However, since the model proved to be successful, it's exciting to imagine how it could be used for larger matters, and perhaps even adopted by other countries.

### VTaiwan's 4 Stage-Process

vTaiwan's process is made up of 4 stages: Proposal, Opinion, Reflection & Legislation.

#### 1. Proposal
- vTaiwan hosts weekly mini hackathons to welcome opinions, proposals, issues to be addressed etc...
- Anyone can submit an issue to the competent gov authority who has the choice to accept (and be accountable for the issue) or refuse

Current limitation: An issue will not move into the vTaiwan process without a government authority being accountable for it and a facilitator taking charge

#### 2. Opinion
- Once a government authority took responsibility for an issue, they collect opinions online using a variety of online tools (Discourse, [Pol.is](http://pol.is/), [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) and [Sli.do](https://www.sli.do/)) .
- This stage may take several rounds, with each round being a month long)

Of the tools above, I zoom in on Pol.is as it is the most interesting and least known piece of software in vTaiwan's stack.

##### Pol.is
[Pol.is](https://pol.is/home) is a machine intelligence debate moderator that clusters participants into opinion groups and allows to visualize them on a 2 dimensional view. Each participant can see where they stand in relation to their friends (if they connect social media) and others.

Users can vote “agree”, “disagree” or “pass” in response to different statements about the issue (like Tinder, but for policy solutions), and/or write up more statements.

Pol.is allows to identify the statements with the widest agreement so that the process can focus on those. In vTaiwan's process, statements with an agreement of 80%+ are included in the agenda of the reflection stage.

For example, despite many differences in opinions, 95% of participants in Taiwan's Uber Debate agreed to the following statement: “*The government should leverage this opportunity to challenge the taxi industry to improve their management & quality control system, so that drivers & riders would enjoy the same quality service as UberX’s*. This, allowed to find a common starting point for the discussion, which then led to a change in policy.

Thus, Pol.is incentivizes crafting well-thought statements that are likely to have wide agreement among different factions (fighting polarization). In addition, the lack of "commenting feature" prevents trolling.

#### 3. Reflection
- The facilitator hosts a hybrid (online-offline) in-person consultation, taking notes in a public screen
- The physical layout of the room is specifically designed to facilitate dialogue
- The administrators monitor live streams to make sure online questions and comments are addressed
- Recordings are released publicly
- After the consultation, digital tools allow the conversation to continue until rough consensus (consent) is reached

#### 4. Legislation
- If a rough consensus is reached, the legislation proposals can be brought to the competent government authority.

Limitation: not all cases brought to vTaiwan led to a regulation reform

The figure below summarizes the 4 stages and the tools used in each of them.

### Final thoughts and further resources
The beauty of this process is that it creates positive feedback loops that move Taiwan towards better democracy. As people see their voices being heard, participation increases, along with the incentive to get educated about the issue. Higher participation from more educated people in turn improves the outcome of the process, and thus its repeated use.

vTaiwan is only one of the innovations introduced by the Taiwanese government.

There's still a lot to learn.

For example, another interesting, more recent initiative is the [Join platform](https://join.gov.tw/aboutus/index/en_US). Its goal is to facilitate two-way communication between citizens and government on policy matters. On it, citizens can ask questions about policies being formulated, propose new policy ideas and share feedback.
