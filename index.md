Born and raised in Sicily, I spent the last 5 years in the US and Asia, and I’m currently based in 
Stockholm.

I have a degree in Economics and an MBA with a focus on sustainability.

In 2017, I co-founded a [plant-based milk startup](https://www.instagram.com/miruku_peanut_milk) in NYC. After a few years of
struggles and many valuable lessons, we were forced to shut the company down.

In mid-2020, I quit my job in the online business industry and started doing some writing on this site. 

Now I’m extremely grateful to be working as a research assistant in the Earth System Finance Program at the Royal Swedish Academy.

My interests are mostly around meditation, regenerative agriculture, community, and entrepreneurship, and 
recently I’ve been fascinated to learn about Complexity Science.

**Other things I love**: [The Tao Te Ching](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Lao-Tzu/dp/0711236496) (translated by Stephen Mitchell), [Chillhop Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yx6BWlEVcY), Good Design, Playing Basketball and Beach Volleyball, Minimalism, Hokusai Paintings.
