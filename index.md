Born and raised in Sicily, I wandered around the US and Asia for a while, now I’m living in
Stockholm.

My interests are mostly around meditation, regenerative agriculture, community, and entrepreneurship, and
recently I’ve been fascinated to learn about Complexity Science.

**Other things I love**: [The Tao Te Ching](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Lao-Tzu/dp/0711236496) (translated by Stephen Mitchell), [Rob Burbea's teachings](https://notes.giorgiop.com/rob-burbea), [Chillhop Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yx6BWlEVcY), learning new things, changing my mind, facing fears, basketball and beach volleyball, Hokusai paintings.
